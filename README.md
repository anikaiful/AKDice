# AKDice

Dice roll simulations. See the more in depth [documentation](AKDice/Doc.md) and/or [usage primer](AKDice/README.md).

A ready-to-roll version of AKDice is present at [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org/packages/AKDice).

Bugs may or may not exist, and thus this library comes without any sort of warranties - YMMV.

# TL;DR
* See [usage primer](AKDice/README.md).
* Visit [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org/packages/AKDice).
